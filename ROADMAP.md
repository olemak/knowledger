- Configuration cascades properly across project hierarchies

## Phase 2: Team Collaboration (Weeks 5-8)

### Multi-tenancy
- [ ] User accounts and workspace management
- [ ] Shared project workspaces
- [ ] Role-based access control (read/write/admin)
- [ ] Team invitation system

### Enhanced Features
- [ ] Knowledge linking (relate entries to each other)
- [ ] Project templates and knowledge inheritance
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] Basic analytics (most referenced entries, etc.)

### Success Criteria
- Teams can collaborate on shared knowledge bases
- Knowledge can be organized and linked effectively
- User onboarding is smooth

## Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 9-12)

### AI-Powered Features
- [ ] Automatic tagging and categorization
- [ ] Conversation summarization
- [ ] Related entry suggestions
- [ ] Knowledge gap identification

### Advanced Search
- [ ] Semantic search capabilities
- [ ] Time-based knowledge evolution tracking
- [ ] Cross-project insight discovery
- [ ] Advanced filtering and faceted search

### Success Criteria
- AI features demonstrably improve knowledge organization
- Users discover valuable connections in their knowledge
- Search is fast and relevant

## Phase 4: Platform & Scale (Weeks 13-16)

### Platform Features
- [ ] Public API for third-party integrations
- [ ] Webhook system for external tools
- [ ] Multiple output formats (dashboards, reports, etc.)
- [ ] Integration with popular dev tools (GitHub, Notion, etc.)

### Business Model
- [ ] Freemium tier structure
- [ ] Team billing and subscription management
- [ ] Enterprise features (SSO, compliance, etc.)
- [ ] Self-hosted deployment option

### Success Criteria
- Clear path to revenue with validated pricing
- Enterprise-ready feature set
- Sustainable infrastructure costs

## Future Ideas (Backlog)

### Advanced Integrations
- [ ] Slack/Discord bots for knowledge capture
- [ ] VS Code extension for inline knowledge

- [ ] Browser extension for web research capture

### Knowledge Products
- [ ] Auto-generated documentation from knowledge
- [ ] Learning path recommendations
- [ ] Team knowledge health metrics
- [ ] Knowledge-driven project planning

### AI Evolution
- [ ] Custom AI models trained on team knowledge
- [ ] Predictive insights for project decisions
- [ ] Automated knowledge curation
- [ ] Natural language queries

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- API response times < 100ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Support for 10,000+ concurrent users
- Sub-second search results

### Product
- Weekly active users
- Knowledge entries per user
- Team adoption rate
- User retention metrics

### Business
- Monthly recurring revenue
- Customer acquisition cost
- Net promoter score
- Enterprise customer pipeline

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database scaling**: Plan for read replicas and sharding
- **Search performance**: Evaluate dedicated search engines if needed
- **MCP adoption**: Ensure value even without MCP integration

### Market Risks
- **Competition**: Focus on developer-specific needs vs general knowledge tools
- **Adoption**: Start with power users and expand
- **Pricing**: Validate willingness to pay early

### Resource Risks
- **Development capacity**: Keep scope focused on core value
- **Infrastructure costs**: Monitor usage patterns and optimize
- **Team scaling**: Plan for key technical hires
